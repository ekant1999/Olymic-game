            <h2>OLYMPICS HISTORY</h2>
            <p>According to historical records, the first ancient Olympic Games can be traced back to 776 BC. They were dedicated to the Olympian gods and were staged on the ancient plains of Olympia. They continued for nearly 12 centuries, until Emperor Theodosius decreed in 393 A.D. that all such "pagan cults" be banned.
         </p>
          <h2>OLYMPIA</h2>
            <p>Olympia, the site of the ancient Olympic Games, is in the western part of the Peloponnese which, according to Greek mythology, is the island of "Pelops", the founder of the Olympic Games. Imposing temples, votive buildings, elaborate shrines and ancient sporting facilities were combined in a site of unique natural and mystical beauty. Olympia functioned as a meeting place for worship and other religious and political practices as early as the 10th century B.C. The central part of Olympia was dominated by the majestic temple of Zeus, with the temple of Hera parallel to it.</p>
            <h2>THE GAMES AND RELIGION</h2>
<p>The Olympic Games were closely linked to the religious festivals of the cult of Zeus, but were not an integral part of a rite. Indeed, they had a secular character and aimed to show the physical qualities and evolution of the performances acco</p>
<h4>AS A SACRED PLACE USED REGULARLY IN RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES, AS WELL AS PLAYING HOST TO THE ANCIENT GAMES, OLYMPIA WAS AT THE CENTRE OF GREEK CIVILISATION. RENOWNED EXPERT PAUL CHRISTESEN GIVES OLYMPICORG A UNIQUE INSIGHT INTO OLYMPIA AND HOW THE SITE CHANGED AS THE GAMES GREW.</h4>         
<p>At its heart the Ancient Olympic Games was a religious festival held in a religious sanctuary Paul Christesen, professor of Ancient Greek History at Dartmouth College USA explained.

As Christesen went on to say It was not just a matter of playing SPORTS. And central to this concept was the site itself. Olympia lay on the north-western corner of the Peloponnese.

Zeus, King of the Greek Gods, was said to have taken up residence in Olympia around 1200BC when the Eleans conquered the surrounding area. The fearsome deity marked his ascension by hurling a thunderbolt into the sacred grove from his home atop Mount Olympus.

The city state of Elis, the administrative centre of which was about a days walk north from Olympia, ran the Games throughout the vast majority of its life cycle, with the Eleans seizing full control from their local rivals the Pisatans in 572BC. Despite the stadium accommodating more than 40,000 people during the height of the Games popularity in the second century AD, it always remained a deeply rural setting.

We know that they actually planted the stadium with wheat, Christesen said. It was a big empty space that wasnt being used most of the time, so except in the run-up to the Games, when they got it all cleaned up, it was just a wheat field.

From the first edition in 776BC until 550BC, the Games took place among the sanctuary itself. The sacred olive tree of Zeus, from which the victory wreaths were cut, marked the finishing line for all races. The first stadium, a simple affair using the natural embankments of the surrounding hills, remained within the deified area too. The discovery of more than 150 wells dating to this time indicates that even this early in the life of the Olympic Games, they attracted considerable attention.

By the mid fourth century BC the third incarnation of the stadium was built.  So while Olympia is a sanctuary to Zeus we know that he wasnt the only deity worshipped at the site. There were over 70 different altars, you could sacrifice to pretty much anyone you wanted to.

While the Eleans maintained a permanent presence at Olympia, conducting monthly sacrifices, the site turned, for one week per year, from an essentially peaceful idyll into the mad, riotous centre of Greece.

Anyone who wanted to get a big audience from all over the Greek world showed up in Olympia. 

The fourth incarnation of the stadium came in the first century as, fuelled by the return of chariot racing to the programme in AD17, the popularity of the Games soared. Interest reached a pinnacle in the following century and the fifth and final renovation took place.

Throughout these reincarnations the length of the track in the stadium remained constant. Stories abound as to why it always measured 600ft/192.2m, with the most enchanting being that this was the distance the hero Hercules could run on a single breath.

As well as competition, training took place at Olympia. At first this happened outdoors but during the Hellenistic period (323BC-31BC) the palestra and the gymnasium were built. Home to practitioners of wrestling, boxing, pankration and the long jump, the palestras main feature was a large, square inner-courtyard. It was flanked by colonnades and had an extensive bathing system in the adjoining rooms. The gymnasium was an elongated rectangle with space for both the javelin and discus throwers to do their thing. Both buildings were centres of intellectual debate and learning, with philosophers and teachers taking advantage of the shade and abundance of young minds.

By the Roman period these training facilities, along with the rest of the site, had, quite apart from the religious aspect, become a year-round tourist attraction.

People put up big fancy artworks and dedications, so it became a famous site to go see Greek art, Christesen said. Certainly by the Roman period there were people making a living as guides to the site.</p>
